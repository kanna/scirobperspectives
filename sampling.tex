\section{On Sampling the water column}

\begin{enumerate} 

\item define sampling in the context of ocean science -- systematic
  measurement of variables over space and time, to be able to
  disambiguate cause-effect relationships

\item the importance of measuring variability in 4D (Space X
  Time). That vertical variability in the water-column is more
  pronounced 
  
\item why is it hard? Static-sensor/static field,
  static-sensor/dynamic field, mobile-sensor platform (AUVs
  etc)/dynamic field. Talk about aliasing of space/time. Refer to
  current methods from the Intro section.

\end{enumerate}
