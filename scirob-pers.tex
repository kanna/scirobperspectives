% Our concept
% -----------

% - idea would be to talk about how operational oceanography (i.e. the
% practice of the science) has evolved starting from Darwin’s Beagle
% cruise and of the Challenger. What are its inherent limitations and
% why scientists do what they do; this to address the issues related
% to variability in the water-column, physics (e.g. type 1 vs type 2
% regions), seasonal and temporal (e.g. tidal) variability. All packed
% as an oceanography 101 type of material within a para or two.  

% - then we trace the advent of scientific instrumentation which
% morphed into floats, into gliders and powered AUVs.  

% - talk about how ships themselves have evolved in some form
% (e.g. Falkor’s super-computer [whether you like it or not], and the
% viability of high-bandwidth comms to make remote work feasible
% (e.g. Bob Ballard’s Ocean Space Center and the R/V Nautilus) 

% - talk about satellite oceanography and how remote sensing can and
% has made an impact 

% - how new generations of spacecraft (incl. SmallSats) could alter
% the landscape — e.g. our pitch to Audacious 

% - how software has and can further change how things
% can/might/should evolve — e.g. Machine Learning offline or even
% inline in the perspective of “discovery" 

% - how an ensemble of vehicles can extend the “reach" of the human
% senses onboard the ship and perhaps even from shore with high
% bandwidth comms 

% - extend the above to not just water-column, but benthic work (where
% I know very little) 

% - implications of maritime robotics to open water observations and
% surveillance — i.e. potential use of scientific equipment/software
% for dual use and what and how it might aid the science as well as
% security and commerce  

% - where this all might/could/hope is heading
