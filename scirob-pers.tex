\begin{sciabstract}
  The worlds oceans have been changing rapidly for some time; however
  the observational methods and capacity have hewed to the tradition
  of ship based approaches with discrete measurements to discern
  continuous processes in space and time.  The ongoing revolution in
  Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and sensor development are making
  rapid strides in how we are and likely to observe our global
  oceans. We believe it is only a matter of time for technology to
  make a sustained and large scale impact on how we observe the
  complexity of the upper ocean. The trajectory we take will however
  be important; we offer a perspective on an approach we believe will
  help solve the fundamental problem of undersampling with
  multi-domain ensembles of intelligent, networked robots.
