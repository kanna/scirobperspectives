\section{Robotics and AI in Ocean Observation}

Trace the advent of scientific instrumentation which morphed into
floats, into gliders and powered AUVs.

\begin{enumerate} 

  \item articulate the various 'robotic' vehicles, mobile and
    immobile. Keep this general, so even a buoy is a robotic sensing
    platform

  \item how an ensemble of vehicles can extend the “reach" of the
    human senses onboard the ship and perhaps even from shore with
    high bandwidth comms -- extend the above to not just water-column,
    but benthic work (where I know very little)

  \item Show the figure of which robotic assets are viable for what
    kinds of observation. Overlay bio-physical processes which are
    appropriate and discuss at length why these assets suit those
    specific observations.

  \item Articulate how robots have 'extended the human senses' from
    ship and shore to provide new ways of observing the ocean

  \item In brief -- examples of Machine Learning and other forms of AI
    which can help and how (see below). Machine Learning offline or
    even inline in the perspective of “discovery"

  \item How systematic observation, as against point measurements
    (i.e. dipping a rosette) and using extrapolation, can help. What
    kinds of signals are being missed

  \item Harshness of the environment and operational issues of being
    at sea for sustained presence

\end{enumerate}
